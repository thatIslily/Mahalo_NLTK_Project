# Mahalo_NLTK_Project
Mahalo is designed for publishers/writers looking for guidance on how to describe their book on Amazon to garner the most positive reviews. It is meant to be a preliminary tool to facilitate initial brainstorming sessions when constructing a new bookâ€™s landing page. The tool provides Word Clouds printed by category and topic for the best selling books. Categories and topics are generated from a static dataframe provided by Kaggle and a corresponding scrape of data by unique key, ASIN.
